Arduino Macro Keypad with NeoPixel Feedback

This project turns an Arduino Pro Micro into a small programmable macro keypad with two functional buttons and a mode-switching button. Each button can send different keyboard shortcuts using Keyboard.h, with customizable NeoPixel LED feedback to indicate pressed states and current mode.
